Chelsea learns to code!

I am a Senior Graphic Designer at the Kentucky Derby Museum. I want to learn all about Front End Web Development so I've enrolled in Code Louisville. I love all areas of art, from drawing, photography, to sculpture. I went to UofL and graduated in 2012 with a BFA in Communication Art & Design, and a BFA in 3D Studio with a concentration in Sculpture.
